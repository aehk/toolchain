	abstract = {The typical development environment today consists of many specialized development tools, which are partially integrated, forming a complex tool landscape with partial integration. Traditional approaches for reasoning about tool integration are insufficient to measure the degree of integration and integration optimality in today’s complex tool landscape. This paper presents a reference model that introduces dependencies between, and metrics for, integration aspects to overcome this problem. This model is used to conceive a method for reasoning about tool integration and identify improvements in an industrial case study. Based on this we are able to conclude that our reference model does not detract value from the principles that it is based on, instead it highlights improvements that were not well visible earlier. We conclude the paper by discussing open issues for our reference model, namely if it is suitable to use during the creation of new systems, if the used integration aspects can be subdivided further to support the analysis of secondary issues related to integration, difficulties related to the state dependency between the data and process aspects within the context of developing embedded systems and the analysis of non-functional requirements to support tool integration.},

	abstract = {A key issue in current computer-aided software engineering (CAS) environ- ments is the desire to link tools that address different aspects of the develop- ment process. Typically, these tools are produced by different vendors, each of whom has chosen to focus on a specific part of the overall problem. For example, different tools support architectural design and test case generation. Users of these tools want them to work together to fully support the user's design and development process. Thus, tool integration is intended to produce complete environments that support the entire software development life cycle. There are five types of tool integration issues that must be addressed. These can be termed platform integration, presentation integration, data integration, control integration, and process integration. Each of these is briefly described, followed by a short discussion of the contribution of open architecture to tool integration. The paper concludes with an overview of the integration techniques employed in {IDE's} Software through Pictures 1 environment. Emphasis is given to commercially available products and approaches, reflecting the need of large- scale software developers for these integrated software engineering environments.},
