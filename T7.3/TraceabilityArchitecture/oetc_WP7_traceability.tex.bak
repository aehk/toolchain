\chapter{OpenETCS traceability scope}

Requirements traceability concerns relations between requirements existing at different engineering levels and relations between requirements and other engineering artefacts (models, documents, test cases, code...). All those requirement traceability links can have different semantics including derivation, refinement,  satisfaction, implementation and verification. 

Before defining traceability process and the different link types, it is important to clearly define the scope of the requirements and of the models that we want to trace in openETCS project.
Next paragraphs recall the different engineering levels defined by ISO 15288:2015 (standard concerning systems life cycle) and position OpenETCS requirements, models and documents with regards to those engineering levels.

\section{OpenETCS requirements with regards to standard engineering levels}
\label{sec-1}
ISO 15288:2015 defines 3 main generic levels: 
\begin{itemize}
\item problem definition,
\item system/Sub system definition (recursive decomposition) 
\item building blocks of software, hardware (mechanical, electrical, electronics, plastic...) or procedures that can be realized independently
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{./images/standardRequirementEngineering.png}
\caption{\label{fig:standardReqEngineering}IS0 15288:2015 standard Systems Engineering requirement levels}
\end{figure}

Concerning OpenETCS project, there are 4 main sources for requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item User stories, concerning problem definition
\item CENELEC regulation requirements that are part of stakeholder requirements
\item SRS Subset 026 that can be considered as system level requirements
\item openETCS new requirements created during system definition by decomposition or derivation of SRS Subset 026 requirements
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure} [htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]
{./images/OpenETCSRequirementsWrtStandard.png}
\caption{\label{fig:OpenETCSRequirementsWrtStandard}OpenETCS requirements with regards to standard engineering levels}
\end{figure} 


\section{OpenETCS models with regards to requirement engineering levels}
\label{sec-2}

Models can be used for different purposes including illustration of concepts, formalization of requirements, product breakdown structure... and can have different scopes. Figure \ref{fig:requirementEngineeringWithModels}
shows a possible classification of models aligned on the standard requirement engineering levels introduced in previous paragraph.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]
{./images/requirementEngineeringWithModels.png}
\caption{\label{fig:requirementEngineeringWithModels}Possible classification of models with respect to standard requirement engineering levels}
\end{figure}

If we look at the different models produced in the openETCS project we find:
\begin{itemize}
\item User stories model that refines user stories 
\item OpenETCS architecture model, that describes high level system breakdown structure with system elements and their interfaces
\item Data dictionary model, that stores all messages, data and functions used in architecture interface definitions
\item OpenETCS Onboard Unit functions model, a formal executable model that focuses on chapters 7 and 8 of Subset026 SRS (ETCS Language and messages)
\end{itemize}

In order to depict their scope and relative positions we can try to align them on standard engineering levels presented previously. Figure \ref{fig:openETCSRequirementsAndModels} illustrates those positions.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]
{./images/openETCSRequirementsAndModels.png}
\caption{\label{fig:openETCSRequirementsAndModels}OpenETCS requirements and models with respect to standard requirement engineering levels}
\end{figure}

\chapter{OpenETCS traceability priorities}
\label{sec-1.3} 
Most important traceability chain concerns links between ETCS OBU functions model and Subset026 SRS requirements, especially chapter 7 and 8, and all other requirements created during system analysis, either by decomposition or by derivation to system elements. 
ETCS OBU functional model is detailed down to software level, and as it is a formal model, it becomes possible to generate code from that model. So, if it is possible to demonstrate that this model satisfies (meets) some Subset026 SRS requirements, then it will be possible to establish that software code generated from that model also satisfies those requirements.

Other "nice to have" traceability chains concern system/architecture model and data dictionary (interface definition) model. Those models need to be traced to Subset026 SRS requirements in order to ensure that they are representative of OpenETCS system and complete (all requirements are covered, no missing requirement). Another reason concerns impact analysis: with traceability links, it becomes possible to perform impact analysis through models when system requirements change (just have to follow traceability links to find associated model elements).

Figure \ref{fig:openETCSTraceabilityMainPriority} highlights traceability chains with highest priority (main priority chain has arrows with largest size).

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]
{./images/openETCSTraceabilityMainPriority.png}
\caption{\label{fig:openETCSTraceabilityMainPriority}OpenETCS traceability chains with highest priority}
\end{figure}

\chapter{OpenETCS tool chain Proposition}
\section{Traceability Process}
\label{sec-3}
From the Subset026 SRS specification we want to be able to trace all artifacts
that implement it.
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{./images/trace_archi.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:trace_process}Traceability architecture between artifacts}
\end{figure}

Figure  \ref{fig:trace_process} highlights the different artifacts or activities and their
links. Traceability activities should allow to trace a requirement within all
the artifacts and/or activities that are using it.

The goal of traceability is that, from any artifacts produced, we are able to
track which requirement it realizes, implements  or refers to. These links can
take different form and be done by different tools. 
Two traceability tools will be evaluated before being integrated in the OpenETCS tool chain:
ReqCycle and Reqtify.


The present solution proposes a first "by hand" approach, to deal with
traceability without having all the proper tools already integrated into the tool chain.

\section{First Solution}
\label{sec-4}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{images/first_trace_solution.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:trace_first}Traceability architecture first solution}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:trace_first} proposes a first solution to handle traceability.
The basic idea is to allways refer to the same requirements data base. This data
base is itself directly imported from the subset-026 word document. The data
base provides the list of requirements as well as an unique identifiers for each
requirement. These identifiers are fixed and cannot be modified by any other
tools. But it may be possible for requirement management tools to refine these
requirements but they should guarantee the following rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The requirement's structure is not modified.
\item No requirement should be deleted.
\item Newly added requirements should be either a refinement or a decomposition of an
existing one.
\item The identifier pattern should be respected.
\item Identifiers should stay unique.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Activities Details}

\section{Subset-026 import}
\label{sec-5}
The subset-026 import is realized by a script transforming the Word document
into a req-IF format file.
\subsection{Script description}
\label{sec-2-1}
The script \todo{The script needs a name} generates a hierarchical tree of all traceworthy
artifacts in each chapter of subset-026. Each artifact shall be uniquely
addressable via a tracestring.


\subsection{Unique ID definition}
\label{sec-2-2}
Take the following example:
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{images/tracestring-ex.png}
\caption{\label{fig:reqID_ex}Traceability architecture between artifacts}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Guideline}
The scope of a single requirement ID is a paragraph of text (there are six such
paragraphs in the above example).  requirement IDs are hierarchical. The
hierarchy is a direct mapping of the hierarchy in the original subset-026
text. Levels are separated by a dot. There is a requirement at each level
(i.e. you may truncate the requirement ID to any level and it stays valid).

\paragraph{How to}

Suppose we want to trace the fifth paragraph in the above example i.e
\begin{verbatim}
• End of mission is performed
\end{verbatim}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let \textsl{traceString} be the variable to store the result.
\item Find the current running number of the base list. That is the list which
includes the chapter number. In this example this number equals
\verb+3.5.3.7.+ Set \textsl{traceString} to this number.
\item Count the number of paragraphs in this list item starting with 1 and append
this number in square brackets to the \textsl{traceString} if it is greater than 1.

Note: For the first iteration in the example there is only one such paragraph
(\texttt{If the establishment...}). Hence, we do not append anything. In the
second iteration there are two such paragraphs (\texttt{The on-board shall...} and
\texttt{If this request is not ...}). Hence, the second one will receive an
\texttt{[2]} appendix.

\item Until you arrived at your target paragraph: Append any running number of
sub-lists and remove leading or trailing characters (such as braces). If the
current sub-list is bulleted then the level string always becomes
\verb+[*][n]+ (with n being the running number of that bullet starting at
1). Prefix this new level with a dot (\verb+.+) and append it to the
\textsl{traceString}.

Note: \verb+a)+ is the identifier of one such sub-list item. The trailing brace
will be removed. The bullet points form another (less significant) sub-list.
\item Do step 3.
\item Do step 4 or break.
\item \textsl{traceString} is now the fully qualified requirementID.
\end{enumerate}

This will result in the following requirement ID: \quad \verb+3.5.3.7.a[2].[*][2]+


\section{Requirement Database}
\label{sec-6}
The requirement data base is a ReqIF file-based.

\section{Requirement management}
\label{sec-7}
The requirement management allows us to have a look at the set of requirements
and performs some actions.
The set of requirements can be automatically imported from a Req-IF file.

The requirement management should be use to refine the high-level requirements
from the import. It can be use to give more precise information about :
\begin{itemize}
\item Which requirements are implementable
\item Who is assigned to implement a set of requirements
\item How and if the requirement is decomposed.
\item TODO (list to be refined)
\end{itemize}

In the OpenETCS tool chain this tasks is done with ProR.
Alternatively to deal with the closed source path the requirement management may
be done by Reqtify Gateway of SCADE. 

\section{System Model}
\label{sec-8}

The system model defines block and interfaces between those blocks that realizes
the specification.
This is done with Papyrus. 

The link with the requirement may be included via requirements diagram with a
direct link of requirement in ProR
The explanation to performs the link may be found here \href{https://github.com/openETCS/toolchain/wiki/User-Documentation#tracing-requirements-and-sysml-models}{ProR-Papyrus proxy}.
The links may be viewed through Papyrus an ProR and the requirement may be
directly apply from ProR to a Papyrus elements.


\section{Interface Definition}
\label{sec-9}

Should define the interfaces between the architecture artifacts.  It is used and
set up to facilitate team working together on a big architecture. Its definition
comes from the requirements but can also be refines by the modeling team without
changing the existing implemented requirements.

\section{Functional model}
\label{sec-10}
The function model is the implementation of the system defines in the system
model. It should covers the set of implementable requirements.
